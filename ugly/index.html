Seven a.m., waking up in the morning 
Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs 
Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal 
Seein' everything, the time is goin' 
Tickin' on and on, everybody's rushin' 
Gotta get down to the bus stop 
Gotta catch my bus, I see my friends (my friends)
Kickin' in the front seat 
Sittin' in the back seat 
Gotta make my mind up 
Which seat can I take?
It's Friday, Friday 
Gotta get down on Friday 
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend 
Friday, Friday 
Gettin' down on Friday 
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend
Partyin', partyin' (yeah) 
Partyin', partyin' (yeah) 
Fun, fun, fun, fun 
Lookin' forwardâ€¦</p>
